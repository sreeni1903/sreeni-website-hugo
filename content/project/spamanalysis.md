summary = "Investigated supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to classify deceptive reviews. Aspect level sentiments of the reviews were extracted and used as features for algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, k-NN. Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) features were used for unsupervised classification. Finally, the relationships between the aspects, their sentiments and their relationship with the deceptiveness of the review was studied."
