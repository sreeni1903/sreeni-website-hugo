summary = "For images accompanied with text associated with it, super-resolution of the images was achieved using the contextually similar images. Text mining techniques such as stop word removal, stemming, tf-idf, singular value decomposition followed by K-means clustering to cluster semantically similar images. Alternatively, Doc2Vec was also used and compared with K-means clustering. Convolutional Neural Network was used for image super-resolution."
