summary = "Developed a model that performs time-series prediction of precipitation using artificial neural networks (ANNs) using the historical precipitation data. In addition, an attempt was made to solve the issues like selection of the optimum sample size from the dataset for best prediction accuracy, selection of the optimal feature set, selecting the appropriate search algorithm, selecting the appropriate number of neurons, and the choice of the activation function."
