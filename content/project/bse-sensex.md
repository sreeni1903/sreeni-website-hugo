summary = "This study compares the effectiveness of different types of Adaptive network architectures such as adaptive linear element, feed forward and time delay neural networks in one-step ahead prediction of the daily returns of Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index (SENSEX). The performance of each network is evaluated using 17 different performance measures to find the best network architecture. Also, an empirical evaluation of the weak form of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) for the data in reference is carried out."
