summary = "Designed an algorithm to detect fall of elderly people from the accelerometer data in real time. Identified significant features such as magnitude of resultant acceleration, absolute coefficient of wavelet transformed resultant acceleration at high and low frequencies. A threshold based algorithm was developed and the false alarm rate was drastically reduced."
