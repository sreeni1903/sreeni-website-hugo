summary = "Proposed an algorithm that automatically segments the femur bone from the computed tomography images. The edge of the bone from each slice of CT was segmented using morphological filters. Further, an area based approach was used to isolate the femur bone from patella, and the hip bone. The segmented data could be in future be used to create a 3D model of the bone."
