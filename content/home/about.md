# Biography

I am a Graduate Student in the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County working with Dr. Nirmalya Roy in the Mobile, Pervasive and Sensor Computing Lab. My research is in the area of multi-habitant activity recognition, functional and behavioral health analysis. I focus on developing novel computational techniques to investigate the relationship between daily activities and cognitive impairment in older adults. 

Before joining UMBC, I received my Master's in Biomedical Engineering from VIT University. I was also a Visiting Research Student at the University of Adelaide where I worked on developing fall detection algorithm for the elderly people. 

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
