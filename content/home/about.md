# Biography

I am a Graduate Student in the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County working with [Dr. Nirmalya Roy](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~nroy/) in the Mobile, Pervasive and Sensor Computing [(MPSC)](http://mpsc.umbc.edu/) Lab. My research is in the area of multi-habitant activity recognition, functional and behavioral health analysis. I focus on developing novel computational techniques to investigate the relationship between daily activities and cognitive impairment in older adults. 

Before joining UMBC, I received my Master's in Biomedical Engineering from VIT University. I was also a Visiting Research Student at the University of Adelaide where I worked on developing fall detection algorithm for the elderly people. 

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
